<h1>LUNCHVOTE</h1>
<p>Given list of candidates and ranked ballots, calculates an election result.</p>


<h3>Sample Usage</h3>

<p><code>LUNCHVOTE(A2:A, C2:C, D2:D, E2:E)</code></p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p><code>LUNCHVOTE(candidate_list, ballot_1, ballot_2, ... ballot_n)</code></p>

<ul>
  <li><p><code>candidate_list</code> - a vertical range containing unique candidate names.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>If <code>known_data_y</code> is a two-dimensional array or range,</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><p><code>ballot</code> - a vertical range containing numerical representation of a voter's preference order for the candidates specified in <code>candidate_list</code>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A lower number indicates greater preference. For example, If you ranked hypothetical candidates A, B, and C as 1, 2, 3, that means you prefer A to B, and B to C.</li>
      <li>Any candidate not ranked on a ballot is considered tied for last place. For example, if you had candidates A through Z, and ranked A, B and C as 1, 2, and 3, that means you prefer A to B, B to C, and C to <i>every other candidate.</i></li>
      <li>You can use whatever numbers you like. If in the previous example you ranked A as 1337, B as 24601 and C as 999999, that still means you prefer A to B, B to C, and C to every other candidate.</li>
      <li>Abstentions: If <code>ballot</code> is blank or does not contain any numerical values, it is considered an abstention and has no effect .</li>      
    </ul>
  </li>  
  
</ul>
      
      

<h3>How Does It Work? and Further Reading</h3>
<p>LunchVote uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method">Shulze Method</a> (pronounced SHULTZ, like the creator of Charlie Brown) to 
determine election outcomes. Shulze is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">Condorcet Methods</a>, a family of election methods 
that have the wonderful property of selecting the candidate that would beat every other candidate in a one-on-one election (if such a candidate exists).
Though not everyone agrees that the Condorcet Methods are ideal (most notably, in my opinion, the folks at <a href="http://rangevoting.org/">RangeVoting.org</a>. 
I personally can't think of a case where if a 



<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method#Evaluation_by_criteria">Condorcet methods</a>, Schulze was chosen over Ranked Pairs due to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Shulze allows for ties on ballots. For example, a voter could express that their #1 preference is Burgers, but their #2 preferences are <i>either</i> Tacos or Sushi. Ranked Pairs requires that all candidates be ranked with unique numbers which can be burdensome for voters when there are many candidates.</li>
  <li>Shulze runs in O(n^3) time while Ranked Pairs runs in O(n^4). This is a significant difference, especially for an algorithm implemented in JavaScript!</li>
