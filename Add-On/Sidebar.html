<h1>LUNCHVOTE</h1>
<p>Given list of candidates and ranked ballots, calculates an election result.</p>

<h3>Quick Start</h3>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>Select <i>LunchVote -> Create Example Election</i> and watch it fill out a new sheet. Don Cuco is the current winner of this example election, indicated by having a '1' next to it in the <b>Results</b> column. This is because Don Cuco has broad-based support. It's Ash's first choice, Brittany's second choice, and both Rodrigo and Scott's third choice. It's effectively a second choice for Olivia as well since she didn't specify any preferences other than Sugarfish.</li>
  <li>Select cell B1 to see how to use the LUNCHVOTE formula. The range B2:B is the list of <b>candidates</b>, the other ranges are the voters' <b>ballots</b>.</li>
  <li>Lets add a ballot. <b>Change B1 to say =LUNCHVOTE(A2:A, C2:C, D2:D, E2:E, F2:F, G2:G, H2:H).</b></li>
  <li>Note how the election results are unchanged. Don Cuco is still winning because Column H is empty. An empty ballot counts as an abstention. Lets change that! <b>Change cell H1 to say "Marc", and have him vote for Sugarfish as his first choice by putting a 1 in cell H5</b>.</li>
  <li>Sugarfish should now be winning - you should see a 1 next to Sugarfish, a 2 next to In-N-Out, and 3s next to Don Cuco and Panera Bread. It's a bit hard to read though. Lets change that by sorting Column B! <b>Click on the "B" at the top of the column. A box with an arrow should appear next to your pointer. Click on that, then select "Sort Sheet A-Z"</b>.</li>
  <li>Notice how the sheet is now sorted and easier to read, but election results are unchanged. <b>You can sort on any column and it will not affect the outcome of the election.</b></li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Sample Usage</h3>

<p><code>LUNCHVOTE(A2:A, C2:C, D2:D, E2:E)</code></p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p><code>LUNCHVOTE(candidate_list, ballot_1, ballot_2, ... ballot_n)</code></p>

<ul>
  <li><p><code>candidate_list</code> - a vertical range containing unique candidate names.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The first empty space in <code>candidate_list</code> terminates the list. For example if you had a list of 10 candidates and cleared the 8th row, LUNCHVOTE would Stop There.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><p><code>ballot</code> - a vertical range containing numerical representation of a voter's preference order for the candidates specified in <code>candidate_list</code>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A lower number indicates greater preference. For example, If you ranked hypothetical candidates A, B, and C as 1, 2, 3, that means you prefer <b>A to B</b>, and </b>B to C</b>.</li>
      <li>Any candidate <i>not</i> ranked on a ballot is considered tied for last place. For example, if you had candidates A through Z, and ranked A, B and C as 1, 2, and 3 but left every other candidate blank, that means you prefer A to B, B to C, and C to <i>every other candidate equally</i>.</li>
      <li>The size of the number you use doesn't matter. If in the previous example you ranked A as 1337, B as 24601 and C as 999999, that still means you prefer A to B, B to C, and C to every other candidate. Use whatever numbers you like!</li>
      <li>Abstentions: If <code>ballot</code> is blank or does not contain any numerical values, it is considered an abstention and has no effect on the election.</li>      
    </ul>
  </li>  
  
</ul>
      
      

<h3>How It Works and some Further Reading</h3>
<p>LunchVote uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method">Schulze Method</a> (pronounced SHULTZ, like the creator of Charlie Brown) to 
determine election outcomes. I briefly considered using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_pairs">Ranked Pairs</a> or 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting">Instant Runoff Voting</a> but settled on Schulze due to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Though IRV is easy to explain and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting#Global_use">used by many major countries and
   organizations</a>, it fails the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">Condorcet Criterion</a>. Condorcet methods have the 
   highly desirable property of selecting as the winner the candidate that would beat every other candidate in a one-on-one election (if 
   such a candidate exists). For some thorough (if, in my opinion, fallacious) counter-arguments to the importance of the Condorcet Criterion, I recommend the folks 
<a href="http://rangevoting.org/CondorcetExec.html">RangeVoting.org</a>.</li>
   
  <li>In an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method#Evaluation_by_criteria">evaluation of Condorcet methods</a>, Schulze and Ranked Pairs are arguably 
  the best.</li>
  <li>Unlike IRV, Ranked Pairs and Schulze have the desirable quality of returning an ordered list of election results. As such, you can use 
  either method to fill several vacant positions simultaneously. You simply let the <i>k</i> top-ranked candidates win the <i>k</i> available
   seats. I've found this to be particularly useful for planning a wedding guest list! This property can also come in 
  handy if your election winner is unusable for whatever reason in which case you simply use the next candidate on the election result list.</li>
  <li>Ranked Pairs doesn't allow users to indicate ties on ballots, but Schulze does.</li>
  <li>Schulze runs in O(n^3) time while Ranked Pairs runs in O(n^4). This is a huge difference in computation time, especially for an algorithm 
  implemented in JavaScript!</li>
